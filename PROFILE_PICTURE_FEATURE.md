# Profile Picture Upload Feature

## What Was Added

### NGO Profile Screen - Profile Picture Upload

✅ **Features Implemented:**

1. **Image Picker Integration**
   - Added `image_picker` package import (already in pubspec.yaml)
   - Users can select photos from their gallery
   - Images are optimized (max 1024x1024, 85% quality)

2. **Visual Components**
   - Profile picture display with three states:
     - Uploaded image from Firebase Storage
     - Newly selected local image (preview)
     - Fallback to first letter of NGO name
   - Camera icon button appears in edit mode
   - "New photo selected" badge when image is chosen

3. **User Experience**
   - Tap camera icon to select image from gallery
   - Image preview updates immediately
   - Cancel button clears selected image
   - Smooth error handling with user-friendly messages

## How It Works

### In View Mode:
- Shows existing profile picture from `profileImageUrl` field
- Falls back to colored circle with NGO name initial if no image

### In Edit Mode:
- Camera icon appears on bottom-right of profile picture
- Tap camera icon → Opens gallery
- Selected image shows immediately as preview
- Badge confirms new photo selection

### Saving:
- Profile data updates to Firebase Realtime Database
- Image upload to Firebase Storage is **prepared but requires setup**

## Firebase Storage Setup Required

⚠️ **Important Note:**

The image picker and UI are fully functional, but uploading to Firebase Storage requires additional setup:

### Steps to Complete Firebase Storage Integration:

1. **Enable Firebase Storage in Firebase Console:**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Storage
   - Click "Get Started"
   - Set up storage rules

2. **Add Firebase Storage Package:**
   ```yaml
   # In pubspec.yaml, add:
   firebase_storage: ^11.5.0
   ```

3. **Update the Upload Code in `ngoprofile.dart`:**
   Replace the TODO section (around line 115-125) with:
   ```dart
   if (_profileImage != null) {
     final storageRef = FirebaseStorage.instance
         .ref()
         .child('profile_images/$userId.jpg');
     
     await storageRef.putFile(_profileImage!);
     profileImageUrl = await storageRef.getDownloadURL();
   }
   ```

4. **Set Storage Rules:**
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service firebase.storage {
     match /b/{bucket}/o {
       match /profile_images/{userId} {
         allow read: if true;
         allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Current Functionality

✅ **Working Now:**
- Image selection from gallery
- Image preview in profile
- UI updates and animations
- Form validation and data saving
- Cancel functionality

⏳ **Needs Firebase Storage Setup:**
- Actual image upload to cloud
- Persistent image URLs
- Image retrieval across sessions

## File Modified

- `/Users/msk/oneplate/lib/screens/ngoscreens/ngoprofile.dart`

## Testing

1. Open NGO Profile screen
2. Tap Edit button
3. Tap camera icon on profile picture
4. Select an image from gallery
5. See preview update immediately
6. Save or Cancel to test both flows

## Color Scheme

All UI elements use the consistent app theme:
- Purple accent: `#6C63FF`
- Light gray background: `#F5F5F5`
- White containers
- Professional shadows and borders
